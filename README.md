A simple Blockchain example programmed soley in Python3.

Programmed in an attempt to improve my programming skills in Python

Uses a webserver powered by Flask and server requests are handled with the Requests module.

# Initial Setup:
 - Ensure to install both dependendies, Flask and Requests, or the program will not work.
 - Run "host.py"
  - Run "ClientV2.py"
