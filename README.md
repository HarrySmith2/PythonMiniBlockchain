# PythonMiniBlockchain

A simple Blockchain example programmed in Python3.

I begun this project a way to improve my programming and algorithmic thinking skills. Eventually it turned into a fully fledged project I completed in a little over 9 months.

The client is able to communicate with the Flask server using the Requests module.

# Initial Setup:
 - Ensure to install both Python dependendies, Flask and Requests.
 - Run "host.py"
  - Run "ClientV2.py"
  
 - Both programs will inform you if you have the correct dependencies installed. 
 - You can control and query the Blockchain from the Client!
